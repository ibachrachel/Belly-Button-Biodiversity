### Module 12 Challenge: Javascript, CSS, Plotly, and Dashboards

## Overview

*Background*

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

*Purpose*

Data needs to be conveyed to the volunteers and other researchers. For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to the company, Improbable Beef, they need to know what bacteria species are colonizing their body. Some of the bacteria would be suitable to sell to Improbable Beef for their synthetic beef production, but others will not be. Regardless of the volunteers decision, the information must be provided to them in a way that is easily navigated. Interactivity is a must for this project.
